There are many different options for building a nmeta lab network. The
choice is likely to come down to what resources you have and the use cases
you want to test.

Virtual labs are easy to set up and don't require specialised hardware,
but aren't useful for testing devices in the real world.

Physical labs are harder to construct and require hardware, but can be
used to connect real-world devices.

This lab is based on a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND Hardware Version 2.1 home router
that is re-flashed to run OpenWRT with Open vSwitch running OpenFlow (yes, that's
three different pieces of software that have the word 'Open' in them...)

On an Ubuntu 16.04.2 server (can be virtual) with at least 30GB of disk space,
