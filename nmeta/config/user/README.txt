For custom configuration settings, create a file in this directory called
config.yaml and add key value pairs as necessary to override settings
in the default config.yaml file.

For a custom policy, create a file in this directory called main_policy.yaml.
Be aware that it will completely override the default main_policy.yaml
settings.

Note that your file(s) will not be part of the distribution as it is
excluded in the .gitignore file.
